Everything to Learn is Earthier a Mere Concept Related to a Science Branch or Tech Tool at Some Tech Container
So, we have THE TOOL WORLD and THE CONCEPT WORLD Interact with Each Other
# THE TOOL WORLD Definition
- Tech Have Many Domains (Software Development, Networking, Data)
- Every Domain Have Some Fields (Web, Mobile, Analysis, Visualize)
- Every Field Have Some Branches (job Profile) (Back-end, Front-end, Network Administration)
- Every Branch Include some Container to work by (C#, ASP.net, Python, Nmap, Excel)
- Every Container Contain some Tools/Libraries (OOP, NumPy, Pandas, Pivot Tables)
- Every tool Have some Sub_Tool (Classes, Objects, Function)
- Every Sub_Tool MAY have Sub_tool_Detail

- Tech Domains have Many Tech Fields
- Tech Fields may be Nested Under Multiple domains (it’s rare, but it will be for more flexible Framework)
- Tech Field Have Multiple Tech Branches and Vice Versa (For Flexibility Only)

- 

# The CONCEPT WORLD Definition

- There are Concepts
- Concepts may Have Sub-Concepts
- Sub-Concepts may have subConcept_Detail
- Concepts are Included Mainly under one Science Branch (Algebra, Statistics, Genetics)
- Science Branch is nested Mainly under Science Field
- 


# The Interaction

- The tool may be Direct Applying of Concept (and that’s very rare since that tools are heigh hierarchical Collections of things)
- Every sub-tool may be direct Applying of concept (that’s the Common case)
- But sub-tool may be applying of sub-concept
- May be no Relations Between TOOL WORLD and CONCEPT WORLD







-Everything to Learn is Earthier a Mere Concept or Tool at Some Container

as Example (tables, Data Entry, Aggregation Functions, data visualization) those are Concepts have Sub_Concepts and Concept_Detail

 BUT (MS Excel, C#, HTML, Python) Considered as Containers has a bunch of tools like (Pivot Tables, OOP, Headings, Numpy)and Every Tool have Sub_Tool and Tool_Detail  
-Every Container Represent an app, Software, Platform, Framework, Programming Language 

-Every Container is Dependent, but Containers Interlock with Each other
-Every Container Have Many Tools, But every Tool is Included at only One Container
BUT
-You May Found tools from Different or Same Containers have Similarities, in this case we could it


Every Concepts May Be Applied by Many tools, and Every Tool may have More than one Concept

- Every tool may Have Sub-tool
- Every Concept may Have Sub-Concept

----WARNING : Every THING have to Stick at The Hierarchy Level as it Begin at, for Example: If you Consider NumPy as a Tool(not python sub-tool) so it has to be a tool Forever----
